Sup Y'all

Based on the idea of a kaossilator through use of the macbook pro trackpad. 

This depends on three libraries:
MacMultitouch (GlulogicMT.jar)
MacbookAccelerometer
JSyn

They are included. The first two work only on recent macbooks. This is designed for them. There is a fallback for other devices, but it offers much less functionality right now and for the foreseeable future.

To compile and run:
open terminal and cd to the repository's home directory
then run the example shell.

$ ./runTest.sh

For windows:
run winRun.bat

Be forewarned that this was not intended to run on PCs. Many features will be missing and the audio library may not be as robust.
