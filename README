A very rough proof of concept for CS4590 proj 2.

Based on the idea of a kaossilator.

This depends on two libraries:
MacMultitouch (GlulogicMT.jar)
JSyn

They are included.

To compile and run:
open terminal and cd to the repository's home directory
then run the example shell. it may need 'sudo' properties

$ sudo ./runTest.sh
