Sup Y'all

A very rough proof of concept for CS4590 proj 2. Much construction is being done here.

Based on the idea of a kaossilator through use of the macbook pro trackpad. 

This depends on three libraries:
MacMultitouch (GlulogicMT.jar)
MacbookAccelerometer
JSyn

They are included. The first two work only on recent macbooks. This is designed for them. There is a fallback for other devices, but it offers much less functionality right now and for the foreseeable future.

To compile and run:
open terminal and cd to the repository's home directory
then run the example shell.

$ ./runTest.sh
